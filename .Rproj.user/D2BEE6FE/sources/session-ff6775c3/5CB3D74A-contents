### [CDC Impact Assessment](https://health2016.globalchange.gov/)

#### Assessment Summary/Intro

##### Significance of Climate Change on Health
    - Different individuals and communities experience climate-related health risks to different degrees.
    - Compounding and cascading health impacts can result from exposure to multiple climate change threats simultaneously.

##### Changing Weather and Climate Phenomena
    - Areas currently experiencing these threats may face worsening impacts (e.g., higher temperatures, increased storm intensity, rainfall, storm surge).
    - New health threats could emerge in previously unaffected areas (e.g., toxic algal blooms, waterborne diseases due to warming waters).
    - Changes in the timing of health threat seasons may also occur.

##### Health Impacts of Climate Change
    - Climate change can affect human health in two key ways:
        1. **Exacerbating existing health problems** that are already influenced by climate or weather factors.
        2. **Creating unprecedented or unanticipated health problems** in places where they have not previously occurred.
        
#### Extreme Events

#####  Projections of Extreme Events
    - Climate change projections show an increase in the occurrence and severity of certain extreme events by the end of the century.
    - For some extremes, the links to climate change are more uncertain.

#####  Current Impacts in the United States
    - Certain regions have already experienced significant impacts from changes in:
        - Frequency
        - Intensity
        - Duration of extreme events
    - Impacts include loss of life and economic damages.

#####  Health Impacts of Extreme Events
    - Health risks from extreme events can occur:
        - **During the event** (e.g., drowning during floods).
        - **Before the event** (e.g., during disaster preparation).
        - **After the event** (e.g., during post-event cleanup).

#####  Extended Health Risks
    - Health risks may arise long after the event or in locations outside the affected area due to:
        - Property damage
        - Asset destruction
        - Loss of infrastructure and public services
        - Social and economic impacts
        - Environmental degradation

#####  Simultaneous or Successive Extreme Events
    - Unique health risks arise if multiple extreme events occur simultaneously or in succession in the same location.

#####  Severity of Health Impacts
    - The severity and extent of health impacts depend on:
        - The physical impacts of the extreme events.
        - Human, societal, and environmental circumstances at the time and place where events occur.
        
#### Temperature-Related Death and Illness

#####  Heat-Related Illnesses
Hotter-than-average summer days compromise the body's ability to regulate temperature.
    - Extreme heat can cause:
        - Heat cramps
        - Heat exhaustion
        - Heatstroke
        - Hyperthermia
    - Prolonged high temperatures increase hospital admissions for:
        - Cardiovascular disorders
        - Kidney disorders
        - Respiratory disorders

#####  Cold-Related Illnesses
Colder-than-average winter days also compromise the body's ability to regulate temperature.
    - Extreme cold can lead to:
        - Hypothermia
        - Frostbite

#####  Worsening of Chronic Conditions
    - Temperature extremes can exacerbate:
        - Cardiovascular disease
        - Respiratory disease
        - Cerebrovascular disease
        - Diabetes-related conditions

#### Air Quality Impacts

#####  Effect of Climate Change on Air Quality
    - Climate change influences both indoor and outdoor air quality.
    - Modified weather patterns impact the levels and locations of outdoor air pollutants, such as:
        - Ground-level ozone (O3)
        - Fine particulate matter

#####  Impact of Increasing CO2 Levels
    - Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels promote the growth of plants that release airborne allergens (aeroallergens).
    - Changes in outdoor air quality and aeroallergens also impact indoor air quality as:
        - Pollutants
        - Aeroallergens

#####  Health Impacts of Poor Air Quality
    - Poor air quality, whether outdoors or indoors, negatively affects:
        - Respiratory systems
        - Cardiovascular systems

#####  Effect of Higher Pollen Concentrations
    - Increased pollen concentrations and extended pollen seasons lead to:
        - Higher rates of allergic sensitization
        - More frequent asthma episodes
        - Reduced productivity at work and school

#### Water-Related Illness

#####  Impact of Climate Change on Water Resources
Climate change is expected to affect both fresh and marine water resources across most of the United States.
These changes will likely increase exposure to water-related contaminants that cause illness.

#####  Types of Water-Related Illnesses
**Waterborne diseases** caused by pathogens such as:
Bacteria
Viruses
Protozoa
**Illnesses caused by toxins** produced by:
Harmful algae
Cyanobacteria
**Illnesses caused by chemicals** introduced by human activities.

#####  Exposure Pathways
    - Exposure occurs through:
        - Ingestion of contaminated drinking water
        - Inhalation or direct contact with contaminated recreational water
        - Consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish

#####  Climate Change Factors Affecting Water-Related Illnesses
Factors influencing growth, spread, and toxicity of water-related pathogens and toxins:
Temperature
Precipitation and related runoff
Hurricanes
Storm surge
#####  Determinants of Illness from Water Exposure
Illness from exposure depends on:
Human behavior
Social determinants of health affecting exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity

#####  Public Health Safeguards
U.S. agencies implement safeguards to reduce the risk of exposure and illness, including:
Water quality monitoring
Drinking water treatment standards and practices
Beach closures
Advisories for boiling drinking water and shellfish harvesting
        
#### Food Safety, Nutrition, and Distribution

#####  Importance of a Safe and Nutritious Food Supply
Food security depends on a stable, safe, and nutritious food supply.
Climate change impacts on food production, prices, and trade have been widely examined.
The report *“Climate Change, Global Food Security, and the U.S. Food System”* found that:
Climate change will likely disrupt food availability, decrease access to food, and make utilization more difficult.

#####  Focus of the Chapter: Less Reported Aspects of Food Security
This chapter examines the impacts of climate change on:
Food safety
Nutrition
Distribution

#####  Pathways by Which Climate Change Affects Food Safety, Nutrition, and Distribution
**Rising Global Temperatures and Changing Weather Patterns**
Consequences include:
Increased contamination and spoilage of food.
Disruptions to food distribution systems due to extreme weather events.
**CO2 Fertilization Effect on Plant Photosynthesis**
Higher CO2 levels stimulate plant growth and carbohydrate production.
However, this can reduce protein and essential mineral content in key crops like:
Wheat
Rice
Potatoes
Negative implications for human nutrition.

#### Mental Health and Well-Being

#####  Mental Health as an Integral Component of Climate-Related Health Impacts
    - The effects of climate change on mental health and well-being are key parts of overall human health impacts.

#####  Range of Mental Health Consequences
Mental health effects vary from:
Minimal stress and distress symptoms
Clinical disorders, including:
Anxiety
Depression
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Suicidality
  
#####  Broader Consequences on Individuals and Communities
    - Climate change affects:
        - Everyday life
        - Perceptions and experiences of individuals and communities
    - These effects influence how people attempt to understand and respond to climate change and its implications.

#####  Interactive and Cumulative Nature of Climate Change Effects
Mental health consequences rarely occur in isolation.
Climate change effects interact with other:
Social stressors
Environmental stressors
These cumulative effects are critical in understanding the full scope of climate change's impact on human health and well-being.


#### Populations of Concern

#####  Current and Future Health Impacts of Climate Change
    - Climate change is already causing a variety of health impacts.
    - These impacts are expected to continue and vary across different population groups in the United States.

#####  Factors Determining Vulnerability
Vulnerability is influenced by three key factors:
Sensitivity to climate change-related health risks.
Exposure to those risks.
Capacity to respond to or cope with climate variability and change.

#####  Populations of Concern
Vulnerable groups include:
People with low income
Communities of color
Immigrant groups (including those with limited English proficiency)
Indigenous peoples
Children and pregnant women
Older adults
Vulnerable occupational groups
Persons with disabilities
Persons with preexisting or chronic medical conditions

#####  Characterizing Vulnerability
Considerations should include how these populations experience:
Disproportionate risks
Multiple risks
Complex risks to health and well-being in response to climate change.

# Heat Waves - 9/10

## Discussion Questions

Think back to a school you attended before college (elementary, middle, high school, etc.). Describe at least one way in which a school you attended could improve infrastructure to accommodate a hotter world. 

Do you think your school was better or worse than others in that region or around Omaha in this respect?

What are some of the physiological/medical constraints that make some people more or less vulnerable to the effects of heat waves?

What are some of the social/economic/structural inequities that make some people more or less vulnerable to the effects of heat waves?

Describe a few Omaha-specific trends, systems, pitfalls, or gaps that make some communities or identities more vulnerable to the negative impacts of heat than others?

If you were specifically looking to vote for a local official to mitigate urban heat island inequity, what kind of policy might they be proposing?

Should we name heat waves? Why or why not?

What are some of the ways your daily routine/lifestyle buffers you from the effects of extreme heat? Are there communities, identities, or other factors that prevent others from accessing any of these strategies or resources?

Pick one of the vulnerable communities mentioned in class and brainstorm mitigation strategies to specifically target that group.

# Fire & Air Polltuion - 9/12

## Discussion Questions

Which of the 3 myths debunked in the video surprised you the most and why?
