# Foundations of Conservation Biology

## Ch 1. The State of Our Planet

### W1D1 8/26/2024

#### State of the Global Environment (7)

##### Land
More than 50% of the inhabitable land surface has been transformed in some way to support the growing human population.
Most habitat loss has occurred in the last 100-200 years.
>Figure 1.5

##### Mediterranean Forests and Temperate Forests
More than 2/3 of the habitat was converted to other land-uses (mostly agriculture) by 1950.

##### Temperate Broadleaf Forests, Tropical and Subtropical Dry Forests, Flooded Grasslands and Savannas, Tropical and Subtropical Grasslands
More than half of the land area was lost by 1990.

##### Desertification
>Desertification occurs when soil degradation by human activity causes relatively dry areas of land to become increasingly arid and lose their water bodies, vegetation, and wildlife.

##### Fragmentation
Most of the land-based habitats not heavily polluted or desertified are highly fragmented.
More than 70% of the world's forests are within 1 km of a forest edge.

#### Climate
There is consensus among scientists that Earth's climate in changing rapidly and that these changes are almost entirely due to human activities.
Anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases have increased dramatically in the postindustrial era, reaching unprecedented concentrations.
>Figure 1.6A

The planet's average surface temperature has warmed by 1.4 degrees F
>Figure 1.6B
  
  This was measured by detailed observations of the Earth's surface temperature assembled and analyzed by several independent research groups
    Cooborated by other observations:
      -Rising sea levels
      -Ocean acidification
      -Decreased Snow and Ice Cover
      -Increased frequency and severity of extreme events like fires and hurricanes
      >Figure 1.6C-F

##### Species Redistribution
Influencing food security and patterns of disease transmission
Altering the Phenology of Species
  -Biological asychornies

#### Oceans
Oceans and seas cover 70% of the Earth's surface and represent 99% of the living space on the planet
Generate roughly half of all the oxygen we breathe
Produce a third of the oil and gas we burn
Absorb nearly 30% of the carbon dioxide we generate
Nearly 66% of the ocean and 77% of exclusive economic zones have shown increased human impact, driven mostly by effects on marine ecosystems imposed by fishing, climate change, and ocean- and land-based stressors.
>Figure 1.7
>Exclusive Economic Zones are areas of the sea where nations have exclusive rights for exploration and use of marine resources.

#### Freshwater
Most of the water on earth is either saline or frozen.

##### Dams
Humans now appropriate more than half of all accessible freshwater runoff
  -Most of that (70%) is for agriculture.
2/3 of all of Earth's rivers were regulated by the turn of this century.
Dams have altered the global flux of water and sediment from contents to oceans.
  -Little water now reaches the sea from the Colorado, Nile, and Ganges Rivers
  -On a global basis, 48% of river volume is moderately to severely affected by either flow regulation or fragmentation, or both
  >Figure 1.8
  
##### Wetlands
Long-term loss of natural wetlands averaged 54% to 57% but may have been as high as 87% since 1700 CE.
Inland wetland loss is occuring faster and more broadly than coastal wetland loss.

### Origins of Conservation {.independent}
>The Anthropocene is an era of unprecedented biological change, characterized by large declines of wildlife populations, local extirpations of many species, rapidly increasing rates of global extinction, and homoegenization of biological communities across the planet's oceans and land surface.

**The Primary Goals of Conservation Biology**
1. To investigate and describe the full variety of life on the planet./
2. To evaluate and predict the effects of human activities on biodiversity./
3. To develop practical solutions to protect and manage biodiversity sustainably./

#### Premodern societies {.independent}
Significant environmental degradation has always accompanied humankind.
**The Noble Savage Trope**
An idea that romanticizes primitive cultures as symbolizing the innate goodness of humanity, free from the corrupting influence of civilization.

### Contemporary Conservation Biology
>Add slides from Table 2.1 Here

**Post-War Economic Growth**
-deregulation of businesses and industry to encourage postwar prosperity

***The Golden Age*** (1950s-1970s)
-Unprecedented growth of manufacturing and industry
-vast development of public works in energy, sanitation, and transportation systems
-unrestrained urban sprawl
-widespread introduction of fertilizers, pesticides, and heavy machinery in agriculture

#### Consequences of Economic Expansion

##### London's Great Smog (1952)
Thousands died and 100,000 fell ill after a blanket of smog covered London for five days in 1952. Cold weather combined with windless conditions allowed airborne nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and soot from coal burning to form a thick layer of smog over the city. Recent research has shown that 12,000 premature deaths can be partially attributed to this smog.

##### Love Canal (1953)
In the 1940s, the Hooker Chemical Company began dumping 21,000 tons of industrial waste into the Love Canal near Niagara Falls, NY. After the site was later sold and developed, Love Canal residents reported strange odors and blue goo bubbling into their basements. High rates of asthma, miscarriages, mental disabilities, and other health problems brought Love Canal into the spotlight in 1978, and subsequent surveys found that 56% of children born there between 1974 and 1978 had birth defects. New York State Health Commissioner David Axelrod called the incident a “national symbol of a failure to exercise a sense of concern for future generations.” The U.S. government soon after passed the Superfund law.

##### Bikini Atoll (1954)
Between 1946 and 1958, the United States detonated 23 nuclear devices at Bikini Atoll. In 1954, one of those detonations exposed 23 crew members of the Japanese fishing vessel Lucky Dragon 5 to radioactive fallout, leading to acute radiation sickness. Years of nuclear testing so contaminated the soil and water at Bikini Atoll that the site was ultimately rendered a nuclear wasteland, with radiation levels in 2016 continuing to be above the established safety levels for human habitation. The United States ultimately paid the islanders and their descendants $125 million in compensation for damage caused by the nuclear testing program and displacement from their home island.

##### Minamata Disease (1956)
In 1956, Chisso Corporation’s industrial wastewater containing highly toxic methylmercury was released into Minamata Bay and the Shiranui Sea. As the mercury bioaccumulated in shellfish and fish that were eaten by the local populace, individuals began to show signs of neurological disorder, including numbness and difficulty seeing, hearing, and swallowing. Initial symptoms were followed by severe convulsions, coma, and eventual death, and 2265 fatalities are recognized as a direct consequence of this pollution event.

##### DDT (1962)
After World War II, use of the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was rampant. DDT was promoted as a wonder chemical: the solution to pest problems large and small. But in her groundbreaking 1962 book Silent Spring, Rachel Carson highlighted the dangers of DDT and the disastrous consequences of the indiscriminate use of insecticides on the environment and its wildlife. Carson’s book, and testimony before the U.S. Congress, helped trigger the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which subsequently banned the use of DDT.

##### Santa Barbara Oil Spill (1969)
The third-largest oil spill in U.S. history fouled the Santa Barbara Channel off the coast of California. Prominent media coverage, with pictures of seabirds, dolphins, sea lions, and elephant seals covered in oil, sparked public outrage.

#### Cuyahoga River (1969)
After being polluted for decades with industrial waste, an oil slick on Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River caught fire. A subsequent picture in Time magazine of flames leaping from the water to engulf a ship helped catalyze the environmental movement in the United States.

##### Seveso Disaster (1976)
In July of 1976, an explosion at a chemical manufacturing plant north of Milan, Italy, released tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) into the atmosphere, adversely affecting the nearby town of Seveso. Shortly thereafter 3300 animals died and many more were euthanized to prevent the spread of contamination into the food chain. Children were hospitalized with skin inflammation, and nearly 500 people were found to have skin lesions.

##### Portsall Oil Spill (1978)
A huge crude oil tanker, the Amoco Cadiz, ran aground on Portsall Rocks off the coast of Brittany, France, split into three parts, and leaked 1,604,500 barrels of crude oil. The spill contributed to the largest loss of marine life ever registered from an oil spill. Millions of dead sea urchins and mollusks washed ashore after the event. More than 20,000 dead birds were recovered, and dead oysters were approximated at 9000 tons.


#### Formation of Conservation Biology as a Discipline

#### The Conservation Biology Explosion
>Figure 2.7 The growing interdisciplinary nature of conservation biology

#### Core Principles and Values of Conservation
Michael Soule's essay: *What is Conservation Biology*
-laid out key characteristics of the discipline
-contrasted it with environmentalism, which is based largely on philosophical, religious, and ethical arguments
-argued that conbio was a new scientific discipline and a **crisis discipline** at its core

>**Normative** = Subjective, Value based
>**Positive**  = Objective, evidence-based

#### Soule's Normative Postulates
>Figure 2.8

1. Diversity of organisms is good.
2. Ecological complexity is good.
3. Evolution is good.
4. Biodiversity has intrinsic value.

>criticized as being little more than philosophical positions that can neither be proven nor disproven.
>>As such this doesn't do much to clarify how the field differs from environmentalism.

#### Soule's Functional Postulates

1. Many species that constitute natural communities are products of coevolution.
2. Ecological processes often have thresholds, after which they become discontinuous, chaotic, or suspended.
3. Genetic and demographic processes have thresholds below which nonadaptive, random forces prevail over adaptive, deterministic forces.
4. Nature reserves are inherently disequilibrial for large, rare organisms.

#### Kareiva & Marvier's 2012 Paper
They argued that:

While conservation biology remains a crisis discipline, it is now more objective and evidence-based than it was in the late 1980s (now a **positive discipline**).
  - no longer a reactive analysis of individual crises where decisions were oncem ade by expert opinion and trial and error.
    -> now a proactive science in which we try to anticipate crises in advance and be prepared with sicentifically grounded contingency plans.
  - Core values are now more human-centric
    -> need to consider a more personal role for people in conservation of human-dominated landscapes

##### The Revised Normative Postulates
>Box 2.2

1. Conservation must occur within human-altered landscapes.
2. Conservation will be a durable success only if people support conservation goals.
3. Conservationists must work with corporations.
4. Only by seeking to jointly maximize conservation and economic objectives is conservation likely to succeed.
5. Conservation must not infringe on human rights and must embrace the priniciples of fairness and gender equity.

>To properly take account of differing value systems, practitioners need to understand how to use decision making tools that integrate objective evidence-based views with subjective value-based views
>>***Structured Decision Making***

### Structured Decision Making
-an approach for the careful and organized analysis of problems relating to natural resource management decisions that integrate objective, evidence-based views with subjective, value-based views.
  -> roots in economics that date back to the 1940's.
#### The goals of SDM
1. Integrate data-driven scientific evidence with human values
2. Make conservation and management decisions transparent
3. Help ensure that decisions are repeatable so that different managers who are faced with the same information can come to the same decision

SDM describes a suite of decision-making tools that share a set of common features.
1. Engaging stakeholders, experts, and policy makers in a join decision-making process
2. Allowing all parties to clearly articulate and evaluate their differing objectives and desired outcomes
3. working through a formal process to identify and evaluate alternative management options
4. Using data and models to quantify the consequences of different management actions
5. Optimizing trade-offs among alternatives that occur due to different human values.

## Ch 3. Biodiversity Concepts and Measurement

### Introduction to Biodiversity
#### Defining Biodiversity
Overview: Why biodiversity is critical for ecosystem function and species survival
Introduction to the hierarchical levels of biodiversity (genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity)

Biological variation is a continuum, and it is notoriously difficult to divide life into discrete categories. 
But this helps organize our thinking, facilitate research, and define boundaries for conservation and management (Figure 3.1).

### Hierarchical Levels of Biodiversity (53 - 65)

#### Genetic Diversity
Refers to the genetic variation within species, both among individuals within single populations and among geographically distinct populations.
Importance of genetic diversity for the adaptability and resilience of populations
-Genetic diversity is ultimately the source of all variation in life-forms on Earth, and it is required for organisms to maintain reproductive vitality, resistance to disease, and the ability to adapt to changing conditions.
Examples of how genetic diversity helps species survive environmental changes

#### Species Diversity
Refers to the variety of species that comprise a biological community—the collection of species that occupy and interact in a particular location.
Overview: Species richness (number of species) and evenness (distribution of individuals among species)
Role of species diversity in maintaining ecosystem stability

#### Ecosystem Diversity
Refers to the different biological communities and their associated ecosystems that comprise whole landscapes.
Definition: Variability among ecosystems within a landscape or region
Examples of ecosystems and their functions (e.g., forests, wetlands, coral reefs)

### Genetic Diversity
The total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species.
Represents variation in genetic characteristics: 
Among individuals in a single population 
Among subpopulations of the same species
Among species

#### Sources of Genetic Variation

##### Population Genetics
>**What is a Population?**
>>A group of individual organisms of the same species living within a given (or particular) geographical area at the same time. 
>>The geographical area is usually defined to be of a size in which individuals are likely to find mates and reproduce.
>>Species that are geographically widespread are often subdivided into distinct breeding groups that live in different geographical areas.

Genetic diversity among individuals in a population arises because the genes on those chromosomes are represented by different alleles
Alleles are different forms of the same gene
-sequences of DNA that are found at the same gene locus (physical, fixed location where a gene sits on a chromosome) but that code for the production of different proteins.
The collection of alleles across multiple gene loci is referred to as an individual’s genotype.


##### Mutation
Definition and role in creating new genetic material
Types of mutations: beneficial, neutral, harmful

##### Recombination
Genetic recombination during sexual reproduction
How recombination increases genetic diversity in offspring

##### Gene Flow
Exchange of genes between populations
Importance of gene flow in preventing genetic isolation and inbreeding depression

#### Measures of Genetic Diversity
##### Heterozygosity
Definition: The presence of different alleles at a gene locus
Importance of heterozygosity for the survival of populations
##### Allelic Diversity
The number of different alleles in a population
Role in increasing the potential for adaptive responses to environmental change
##### Effective Population Size
Concept of effective population size and its influence on genetic diversity
Examples of species with low effective population sizes and their conservation concerns

### Species Diversity
#### The Species Concept
##### Biological Species Concept
Definition: Species as groups of interbreeding individuals that are reproductively isolated from others
Strengths and limitations of this concept

##### Morphological Species Concept
Definition: Species classified based on physical characteristics
Usefulness in paleontology and cryptic species identification

##### Phylogenetic Species Concept
Definition: Species as the smallest group of individuals sharing a common ancestor
Advantages for evolutionary conservation

##### Debate Around Species Concepts
Discussion on the limitations of defining species and the implications for conservation
Examples of species complexes where defining species is challenging (e.g., cryptic species)

### Case Study: Genetic and Species Diversity in Conservation
#### Example: Conservation of a Small Isolated Population
Challenges of maintaining genetic diversity in isolated populations
Role of gene flow and managing effective population sizes
#### Example: The Role of Species Concepts in Conservation Decisions
Implications of different species concepts for prioritizing species conservation
How the reclassification of species can change conservation strategies (e.g., subspecies vs. species)
